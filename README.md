# AIML_Cluster_Prediction_Phase2

Problem Statement :

Once issues are predicted, the next step is to automate or recommend actions for remediation. The challenge in Phase 
2 is to create an agent or system capable of responding to these predicted issues by suggesting or implementing actions 
to mitigate potential failures in the Kubernetes cluster.

What I have done :

1. Restart the affected pods to fix the service disruption automatically.

2. Check system logs to identify any critical errors.

3. Optimize network settings to prevent further disruptions.

4. Monitor CPU and memory usage to catch abnormal spikes early.
